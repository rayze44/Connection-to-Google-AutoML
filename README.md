This program was done for my final year project at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore. The final year project's objective was to design or purchase a drone with the capabilities to detect defects at an elevated height. What I have done is to utilise Google Cloud AutoML to determine the defects of the input images or videos. 

Create folder "DROP IMG" & "DROP VID"
Input images and videos respectively.

Every version was an improvement from the previous version, version 4 being the final version.

Python Version:
Python 2.7

pip install:
image_slicer
opencv
google.cloud
